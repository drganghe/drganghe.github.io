I'm happpy to provide recommendation letters if you were **in my class** or **collaborated with me directly**. If not, I may not know you well enough to write a stong letter. 

When requesting a letter, please send bullet points addressing the following:

- What (class) project did you work on?
- What contributions did you make to the project?
- What challenges did you face during the project?
- How did you handle those challenges?
- Why are you interested in the opportunity or position?

Please also include links to the position or opportunity and note the deadlines. Please reach out at least **one month** before the deadline. If you need letters for multiple applications, please send all submission links together if possible.
