    "text": "New York State is recognized as a climate leader, yet navigating its policies can be challenging without a deep understanding of the policymaking landscape. Here, I’ve aimed to link key policy goals with relevant legislation, agencies, and provide direct access to the original legislative text. I hope you find these resources helpful.\nNotes: ECL: Environmental Conservation Law; Emission reductin baseline: 1990 level; Renewable energy: solar thermal, PV, land and offshore wind, hydroelctric, geothermal electric, geothermal ground source heat, tidal energy, wave energy, ocean thermal, and fuel cells which do not utilize a fossil fuel resource in the process1; ZEV(zero emission vehicles): Battery Electric Vehicles, Fuel Cell Vehicles, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)2.\nUpdates: Distributed PV: On October 17, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that 6 gigawatts (GW) of distributed solar have been installed across New York, a year ahead of schedule3. Storage: On June 20, 2024, the New York Public Service Commission approved the Order Establishing Updated Energy Storage Goal and Deployment Policy which expands the State’s goal to 6GW of energy storage to be installed by 20304."

The cost of solar and wind has plummeted in the past decade, and solar and wind electricity has been achieving grid parity. Low-cost renewables offer new perspectives for energy system decarbonization that was less visioned before. In this talk, Dr. He will discuss the pathways of clean power transition and their system impacts using high-resolution models, to reflect the need for integrating variable renewable energy and phasing out coal to achieve carbon neutrality in the power sector at a low-cost renewables era."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe deployment of renewable energy sources, power-to-gas (P2G) systems, and zero-emission vehicles provide a synergistic opportunity to accelerate the decarbonization of both power and transportation system. This article investigates the prospects of implementing hydrogen P2G technology in coupling the power system and the transportation system. A novel coordinated long-term planning model of integrated power and transportation system (IPTS) at the regional scale is proposed to simulate the power system balance and travel demand balance simultaneously, while subject to a series of constraints, such as CO2 emission constraints. IPTS of Texas was investigated considering various CO2 emission cap scenarios. Results show unique decarbonization trajectories of the proposed coordinated planning model, in which IPTS prefers to decarbonizing the power sector firstly. When the power system reaches ultralow carbon intensity, the IPTS then focuses on the road transportation system decarbonization. The results show that with the P2G system, IPTS of Texas could achieve 100% CO2 emission reductions (relative 2018 emissions level) by adding a combination of approximately 143.5 GW of wind, 50 GW of solar PV, and 40 GW of P2G systems with 2.5% renewables curtailment. The integration of the P2G system can produce hydrogen by use of surplus RES generation to meet hydrogen demand of Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and to meet multiday electricity supply imbalances."

    "text": "Pumped storage hydropower supports China’s transition to renewable energy by generating electricity when the sun is not shining nor the wind blowing.\nA pumped hydro facility pumps water uphill into a reservoir when electricity demand and prices are low, usually at night, then releases it back downhill through turbines to generate electricity when demand and prices are high.\nThe cost of building pumped hydro is high, but a facility lasts for around 60 years, meaning the full life-cycle cost of its power is relatively low. This reliable method for energy storage has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years, linked to the rolling out of China’s carbon emission goals. Between 2015, the year China adopted the Paris Agreement, and 2023, pumped hydro’s installed capacity more than doubled, from 22.8 gigawatts (GW) to 51 GW.\nChina wants to increase this to over 62 GW by 2025, and around 120 GW by 2030, according to a plan released by the National Energy Administration (NEA) in 2021. There is currently 167 GW of pumped hydro in planning or under construction.\nHowever, our recent study indicates that simply building more pumped hydro might not be the most cost-effective approach to achieve a zero-carbon power system.\nInstead, to ensure grid stability and best support the transition to carbon neutrality, existing pumped hydro systems should be optimised while the more economical option of battery storage is widely deployed."

    "text": "Pumped hydro versus batteries\nChina’s solar and wind installed capacity has been increasing dramatically, from 120 GW in 2012 to over 1,200 GW in 2024, NEA figures show. This presents challenges to power system reliability given the variable nature of those energy sources. Technologies like pumped hydro and batteries, which store large amounts of energy, are essential in balancing the grid and increasing the power system’s flexibility.\nThough pumped hydro has a longer operational lifespan and a lower cost per kilowatt-hour, battery storage is more suitable for widespread application due to its faster construction time (less than six months) compared to pumped hydro (4-5 years), and the fact it doesn’t need specific topography or water availability.\nPumped hydro is cost-effective and efficient for large-scale, long-duration storage, while batteries offer greater flexibility and quicker response times. The two technologies can therefore play complementary roles. As of the end of 2023, China had 86 GW of energy storage in place, with pumped storage accounting for 59.3% and battery storage 40.6%.\nAs battery costs have been dropping significantly, there has been a boom in the adoption of battery energy storage, leading to a significant uptick in new projects."

    "text": "The falling price of batteries may leave pumped hydro behind\nWe wanted to examine the role of pumped hydro in China’s power system and consider its optimum capacity in 2025 to 2050. To do so we used open-source software called GridPath to build a detailed model of China’s electricity system, including hourly provincial loads, interprovincial transmission constraints, regional wind and solar profiles, and cost projections for renewables and energy storage.\nOur findings indicate the NEA’s target for 120 GW of pumped hydro by 2030 will be sufficient to balance variable renewable resources. Meanwhile, the cost of batteries, especially those with a four-hour capacity, will continue to decline and be competitive.\nThe study therefore shows that from 2025 to 2050, battery-storage capacity could skyrocket from 21 GW to 858 GW. This positions battery storage as a more cost-effective approach to managing the variability of renewable-energy sources and meeting increasing energy demands in the longer term."

    "section": "The path forward for pumped hydro in China",
    "text": "The path forward for pumped hydro in China\nChina has set ambitious targets to expand pumped hydro as part of its strategy to transition to a clean power system, introducing various supportive policies. For example, several provinces, such as Inner Mongolia, Beijing, and Shandong, have exempted pumped hydro storage from the water resource tax.\nAt the central government level, the National Development and Reform Commission last year introduced a fixed payment for pumped hydro operators based on the capacity of their installations. These “capacity payments” are designed to help operators achieve reasonable returns.\nUnder the current policies and goals in China, optimising pumped hydro projects has become increasingly important. Our analysis produced the following key findings and recommendations that might provide insight as China refines its pumped hydro strategy.\nFirstly, pumped hydro development policies and targets should be integrated in the overall planning of China’s electricity system. Currently, energy storage technologies including pumped hydro are not adequately examined in power system planning. Pumped hydro should be compared systematically with other storage options, generation technologies, and transmission solutions to find the appropriate scale and locations. If not, over-built or mismatched pumped hydro projects could increase power system costs and consumer electricity bills.\nRe-evaluating pricing is also important. The current pricing mechanism for pumped hydro, set by authorities based on investment costs, needs refinement as it could potentially lead to cost over-run and over-investment in projects, which could then raise electricity prices unnecessarily. Introducing competition through open bidding for pumped hydro projects can help control project costs and keep electricity tariffs lower.\nFurthermore, the wholesale electricity market mechanism needs further improvement. Although energy storage is supposedly allowed to participate in the wholesale electricity market, securing profits remains challenging, as the rules are not clear. Reforms could allow the price to be determined by supply and demand, and provide technology-neutral capacity payments, so that energy storage can compete on a level playing field with other technologies.\nLastly, encouraging interprovincial collaborations for pumped hydro projects can enhance the sharing of electricity or storage and improve regional grid stability. Policymakers should work with their counterparts in neighbouring provinces to create a cooperative framework and align regulations. This will support the optimal deployment of pumped hydro and other system resources, resulting in cost savings for consumers.\nCheck the original post at Dialogue Earth."

This fast transiting sector is under pressure to lower its carbon emissions while strive to power the world’s largest manufacturer and fastest growing mid-class. The scale and scope of China’s clean power transition is unprecedented and its impacts are enormouse, yet its trojactories are uncertain. How can China’s power sector achieve carbon netrality will in large impact how can the world meet the net-zero goals. Modeling China’s power transition is both important and challenging.

    "section": "Remarks",
    "text": "Remarks\nThank you, Jessica, for the nice introduction.\nLet me start by congratulating Dr. Cui and the team for the release of such an important and timely report. I want to echo what Prof. Yuan have just shown the implications of China’s coal transition. The report lays down a ground break work to identify low hanging fruits of coal plants retirement and shows a feasible strategy to phase down coal power in China.\nI hope to add a few comments focusing on renewables. You may curious this is coal phase down event, why am I talking about renewables. Here is the thing, it’s good to phase down coal, then where will our electricity come from? The answer is: non-fossil sources, especially renewables! My rationale is that the more we can provide stable and secure renewables supply, the less we will rely on coal, and the better chance we can successfully phase down coal.\nFirst, China’s clean power transition needs two accelerations at the same time. While accelerating phase down of coal, we will need to accelerate renewable development and integration. Renewables will need to first feed all the new demand and then to replace coal. Let’s be real, coal generation is still growing, good news is the share of renewables grows too. In 2021, coal accounts about 62% of total generation, hydro about 16%, nuclear 5%, wind 8%, and solar 4%. Renewables (hydro, wind, and solar) overtook coal in new capacity in 2013, and renewable combined exceeded 50% of the new capacity in 2016, and in 2021, 78% of the new capacity are renewables. According to the latest data from the National Energy Administration, by the end of 2021, the country’s installed wind and solar capacity both exceeded 300 GW, wind 328GW and solar 306GW. To achieve carbon neutrality goal, we need 10x today’s solar and wind capacity by mid-century, that’s the scale of acceleration we are talking here.\nSecond, cheap renewables are a game changer, a renewable dominant path is not just technical feasible, but also cost effective, and with water saving and other co-benefits. This chart from Our World in Data shows that from 2009 to 2019 the cost of PV fell by 90 percent, onshore wind by 70%, and concentrated solar by 16%. The learning rate reaches 36% for PV and 23% for onshore wind, meaning that for every doubling of cumulative installed capacity, the cost of PV fell 36% and onshore wind 23%. 2021 can be described as the tipping point of grid parity or we say, “low-cost renewable era”. In China, the National Development and Reform Commission, canceled the subsidized tariff for new central PV and onshore wind projects, a milestone for renewables. The arrival of grid parity, relative to the 2000 forecast, about 50 years ahead of time; relative to the 2010 forecast, about 30 years ahead of time; relative to the 2015 forecast, about 10 years ahead of time. The early arrival of grid parity accelerates the development of renewable energy and opens new possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality to confront climate change.\nIn a collaborative Nature Communications paper with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we found that if the current trend of declining renewables costs continues, by 2030, wind and solar could provide 39% of electricity generation, together with hydro (14%) and nuclear (10%), the share of non-fossil electricity could be 62%, compared to 50% commonly discussed. What’s more, it will be 11% cheaper than in the reference scenario. Wind and solar together could exceed 1800GW of capacity, compared to the 1200GW national goal. In another collaborative paper with Tongji University, we find cheap renewables reduces the need for carbon capture and storage by 80% in 2050 and saves water consumption for cooling by 10 billion cubic meters annually compared with the reference scenario.\nThird, coal could play a facilitator’s role in integrating renewables, coal needs to reposition or repurpose itself from cornerstone to stepstone in clean power transition. Flexibility retrofitting and converting coal plants to reserved capacity could help to address the flexibility challenges in a renewable dominant grid, even though coal flexibility’s contribution to renewable integration is marginal comparing to building national electricity market and dispersed renewable investments, accordingly to a collaborative paper with LBL published in iScience.\nIn summary, accelerating coal transition and renewable development needs to go hand in hand, and renewable achieving grid parity not just make this technical feasible, but also economic effective, and coal could reposition and repurpose itself from footstone to stepstone in clean power transition."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nChina׳s wind installed capacity has grown at a remarkable rate, over 80% annually average growth since 2005, reaching 91.5 GW of capacity by end of 2013, accounting for over 27% of global capacity. This rapid growth has been the result of a domestic manufacturing base and favorable national policies. Further evolution will be greatly aided with a detailed wind resource assessment that incorporates spatial and temporal variability across China. We utilized 200 representative locations for which 10 years of hourly wind speed data exist to develop provincial capacity factors from 2001 to 2010, and to build analytic wind speed profiles. From these data and analysis we find that China׳s annual wind generation could reach 2000 TWh to 3500 TWh. Nationally this would correspond to an average capacity factor of 0.18. The diurnal and seasonal variation shows spring and winter has better wind resources than in the summer and fall. A highly interconnected and coordinated power system is needed to effectively exploit this large but variable resource. A full economic assessment of exploitable wind resources demands a larger, systems-level analysis of China’s energy options, for which this work is a core requirement."

    "text": "SBU Press Release\n\nStudy Shows Decrease in Renewable Energy Costs May Serve as an Accelerator for Clean Energy Expansion\nJune 1, 2020\nThe News in Brief:\n\nThis study is the first to reveal the implications of cost decrease on power systems and new perspectives on clean power transition.\nThe analysis uses China’s power system as a case study to demonstrate the impact of a fast cost decrease of renewable and storage source, a scenario that could apply to the United States.\nThe study reveals fast decarbonization is both technically feasible and economically beneficial, which offers the prospect of large emissions mitigation with a global environmental impact.\n\nSTONY BROOK, NY, June 1, 2020 – The costs for solar photovoltaics, wind, and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010. A new study led by Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analyses the cost of renewable energy in China and reveals that costs are projected to decline further, thereby bringing new possibilities for the widespread penetration of renewable energy and extensive power-sector decarbonization. The findings, published in Nature Communications, may serve as a model for the United States and worldwide illustrating that decreases in renewable costs may help drive clean energy growth.\nPrevious studies and reports globally have not adequately captured the dramatic decrease in costs of renewable energy and storage and therefore have underestimated the development of renewables. The authors contend that incorporating the new downward trend in costs of renewable energy into models is invaluable for modeling scenarios that are required for developing appropriate energy policies in countries.\n“For too long relying on variable wind and solar resources for electricity generation has been considered a challenge to system operations and as having no economic advantage,” said Gang He, Assistant Professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.\n“Now rapid technological developments and falling costs in renewable energy and storage are undermining this assumption. Our paper is an effort to reveal the implications of such changes for China’s clean power transition.”\nGlobal weighted-average cost of electricity of utility-scale solar PV, onshore wind, and battery storage in China plummeted by 77, 35, and 85 percent, respectively, between 2010 and 2018. The researchers incorporated these falling costs into models for the development of China’s power sector, a factor often overlooked in power sector modelling.\nThe modelling showed four scenarios for China’s power sector up to 2030, the business as usual approach, low cost renewable use, carbon constraints, and deep carbon constraints. Their findings with the models revealed that if cost trends continue, 62 percent of China’s electricity would come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11 percent lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach.\nThe authors emphasize that expansion of renewables under the low-cost scenario would require significant infrastructure support in the form of transmission lines and storage capacity to allow grid stability.\n“The large-scale decarbonization of the power sector requires that several processes take place simultaneously,” explains Dr. He. “Both the renewable and storage capacity and transmission infrastructure must be scaled up quickly. The investment needed for the infrastructure transformation must be acquired and dedicated. And social and economic equity must be addressed during the transition to lower carbon power systems.”\nIf such processes can be achieved simultaneously, added Dr. He, China will be able to increase renewables in an increasingly cost-effective manner. Such a model may show that fast decarbonization is both technically feasible and economically beneficial, a scenario that offers the prospect of large emissions mitigation with a global environmental impact.\nThe research was supported by the Energy Foundation China, and the Hewlett and MJS Foundation through the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract Number No. DE-AC02-05CH11231."

    "text": "Abstract\nWater scarcity and climate change are dual challenges that could potentially threaten energy security. Yet, integrated water–carbon management frameworks coupling diverse water- and carbon-mitigation technologies at high spatial heterogeneity are largely underdeveloped. Here we build a global unit-level framework to investigate the CO2 emission and energy penalty due to the deployment of dry cooling—a critical water mitigation strategy—together with alternative water sourcing and carbon capture and storage under climate scenarios. We find that CO2 emission and energy penalty for dry cooling units are location and climate specific (for example, 1–15% of power output), often demonstrating notably faster efficiency losses than rising temperature, especially under the high climate change scenario. Despite energy and CO2 penalties associated with alternative water treatment and carbon capture and storage utilization, increasing wastewater and brine water accessibility provide potential alternatives to dry cooling for water scarcity alleviation, whereas CO2 storage can help to mitigate dry cooling-associated CO2 emission tradeoffs when alternative water supply is insufficient. By demonstrating an integrative planning framework, our study highlights the importance of integrated power sector planning under interconnected dual water–carbon challenges."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe global surge in solar photovoltaic (PV) power has featured spatial specialization from manufacturing to installation along its industrial chain. Yet how to improve PV climate benefits are under-investigated. Here we explore the evolution of net greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of PV industry from 2009–2060 with a spatialized-dynamic life-cycle-analysis. Results suggest a net GHG mitigation of 1.29 Gt CO2-equivalent from 2009–2019, achieved by 1.97 Gt of mitigation from installation minus 0.68 Gt of emissions from manufacturing. The highest net GHG mitigation among future manufacturing-installation-scenarios to meet 40% global power demand in 2060 is as high as 204.7 Gt from 2020–2060, featuring manufacturing concentrated in Europe and North America and prioritized PV installations in carbon-intensive nations. This represents 97.5 Gt more net mitigation than the worst-case scenario, equivalent to 1.9 times 2020 global GHG emissions. The results call for strategic international coordination of PV industrial chain to increase GHG net mitigation."

    "text": "Background\nThree decades. That is how much time is left to decarbonize the world’s energy systems to limit global warming to 1.5°C, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Achieving this feat requires renewable energy systems be deployed at an unprecedented speed and scale. While daunting, the good news is that this transformation may not cost as much as many expected just a decade ago, thanks to rapid cost declines in renewable energy technologies. Solar photovoltaics (PV) is a prime example. In the last decade, the price of solar modules has dropped 88 percent, making solar cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many parts of the world.\nThis remarkable success story was made possible by the decades-long free flow of goods, talent and capital across multiple countries involved in the solar industry. But the learning processes that have led to these rapid declines are increasingly at risk from policies aimed at localizing production to within national borders and moving away from global supply chains. Such policies have become increasingly popular, in part due to supply chain disruptions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and, perhaps more notably, in response to the concentration of the solar PV supply chain in China, which now comprises 78% of global PV module production (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual solar PV cell production by origin, 2010–2021.\n\n\n\nWe have been studying this phenomenon for years, trying to understand the cost of erecting barriers to international cooperation when it comes to the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies (LCETs) like solar PV. In our recent paper published in Nature, we model the cost of moving away from global supply chains for solar PV modules, concluding that tens of billions of dollars have been saved in solar deployment over the past decade thanks to global supply chains."

    "text": "Learning in Global Versus National Markets\nIn our paper, we use historical deployment and price data in the U.S., Germany, and China—the three largest solar-deploying countries—to model the cost savings from historical global cooperation in the solar PV industry. Using the classic learning curve model, we model historical learning rates in each country from 2006 to 2020, which we call a period of learning in “global market” conditions. We then simulate a counterfactual “national markets” scenario, in which these countries adopt nationalistic trade policies that limit cross-border learning over the same period.\nOur results show a total of $67 billion was saved in solar deployment from 2008 to 2020 thanks to global supply chains ($24 billion, $36 billion, and $7 billion in the U.S., China, and Germany, respectively). We also estimate that under the “national markets” scenario, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly higher—107% higher in the U.S., 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of estimated solar PV module prices under global versus national market scenarios in China (2007–2020), and Germany and the United States (2006–2020).\n\n\n\nWe also compare how these two scenarios might play out going forward. Assuming that capacity grows at a constant annual growth rate (CAGR), we estimate that solar module prices could be 20-30%1 higher in 2030 than they otherwise would be if countries move to complete domestic manufacturing over a ten-year time frame."

    "text": "What About Jobs?\nWhile we focus on cost in our paper, we offer a discussion of other important issues in the solar PV industry. Jobs is a politically salient issue that is often used to motivate moving solar manufacturing to the U.S. (or another country). But this motivation is inconsistent with industry realities.\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that there are ten times more annual jobs in system installation compared with those in the entire manufacturing supply chain. As a result, higher module prices associated with nationalistic policies could lead to lower total deployment, costing potentially thousands more jobs than those gained in manufacturing, which is highly automated in most modern module manufacturing plants.\nThis reality has already played out under the tariffs on imported solar PV modules from China, which have been in place over the past three U.S. administrations. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that Section 201 tariffs implemented under the Trump administration has cost the industry 60,000 jobs, and if new tariffs are added that number could rise to 100,000. Lowering or completely removing these tariffs would almost certainly accelerate solar deployment (and job growth) in the U.S., especially with the tax credit incentives put in place under the Inflation Reduction Act."

    "text": "What About Diversification?\nReliance on a single set of countries in critical supply chains introduces risks to global disruptions, and a diversified solar PV manufacturing base can provide a layer of resilience. A related article in Science, Davidson et al. (2022) provides a framework for balancing the economic and national security risks from decoupling from China in mature and emerging low-carbon technologies. Nonetheless, it is also important to consider the risks associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels for energy. While fossil energy prices are highly susceptible to global disruptions, renewable energy systems have no fuel cost. Furthermore, a dependency now on a country like China for solar panels may not exist forever as manufacturing can shift over time; in contrast, fossil energy sources are geographically fixed, limiting potential future trade partners.\nOf course, countries may choose to diversify for ethical reasons too. The Xinjiang region of China has been come under increased scrutiny from allegations of forced labor. Most of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon is produced in Xinjiang, and policies such as the Biden Administration’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act are aimed at limiting trade with products made in this region. The solar industry has responded with proposed protocols for tracing upstream material supplies, which is an initial step in addressing the issue, but more needs to be done."

    "text": "Policy Implications\nIn a related article in Science, Helveston and Nahm (2019) highlighted China’s critical role in scaling up manufacturing in LCET sectors, including solar, wind, electric vehicles and batteries. Global trade will be critical for scaling up the deployment of these technologies all over the world. While efforts to boost domestic manufacturing of and demand for renewable energy technologies are steps in the right direction, we must not lose site of the timeline left to decarbonize. Erecting barriers to the free flow of goods, talent, and capital in LCET sectors will limit the ability to address the looming climate crisis.\nThis does not mean the U.S. should abandon solar manufacturing. The world will need more supply to meet the scale of deployment necessary for climate goals, and more solar manufacturers adds resiliency to disruptive events such as pandemics and conflicts. As an R&D leader, the U.S. could very likely lead in developing (and potentially manufacturing) the next-generation of solar PV technology. But the U.S. should not penalize firms for buying low-cost, high-quality panels from abroad, not when cost is still a barrier to greater solar adoption.\nThere is a Chinese idiom that has a close corollary in the English-speaking world: 同舟共济(tóng zhōu gòng jì), which roughly translates to “same boat, work together.” Time is not on our side. Countries like the U.S. and China must find a way to address their geopolitical differences while simultaneously working together to lower the cost of LCETs, close the emissions gap and combat climate change.\nJohn Paul Helveston is an assistant professor at the George Washington University’s School of Engineering & Applied Science.

    "text": "Abstract\nWe present an integrated model, SWITCH-China, of the Chinese power sector with which to analyze the economic and technological implications of a medium to long-term decarbonization scenario while accounting for very-short-term renewable variability. On the basis of the model and assumptions used, we find that the announced 2030 carbon peak can be achieved with a carbon price of ∼$40/tCO2. Current trends in renewable energy price reductions alone are insufficient to replace coal; however, an 80% carbon emission reduction by 2050 is achievable in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Target Scenario with an optimal electricity mix in 2050 including nuclear (14%), wind (23%), solar (27%), hydro (6%), gas (1%), coal (3%), and carbon capture and sequestration coal energy (26%). The co-benefits of carbon-price strategy would offset 22% to 42% of the increased electricity costs if the true cost of coal and the social cost of carbon are incorporated. In such a scenario, aggressive attention to research and both technological and financial innovation mechanisms are crucial to enabling the transition at a reasonable cost, along with strong carbon policies."

Nonetheless, it has stepped into a leadership role on climate change after the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement. And so on.\nOften lost in all this is a major advance: China has achieved full electrification for its population of 1.4 billion, even in its remotest villages.\nAbout one billion people worldwide have no electricity, and another 1.5 billion lack reliable electricity so China’s success offers useful lessons for other countries struggling to connect remote, poor areas."

I was born in a small village in Hunan province, in central China, and am old enough to remember a life without electricity. Many people today would panic after an hour’s disconnection from the electricity grid. Where to charge their phone? What to do without a wi-fi connection? Back then, for my family it was normal. Kerosene lamps for light, a wood-save stove for cooking – a model that was already an improvement on previous versions because it used less wood. However, the smoke remained a major source of air pollution, and was especially harmful to women and children, who spent most time indoors.\nProviding electricity to all is about humanity. Without electricity, other essential steps for human development such as providing modern public health services or narrowing the digital divide, are daunting to solve."

    "text": "Huge hurdles\nChina’s road to full electrification has been rough. Initially reliant on imports for its grid and generating capacity, China then had to reshape its institutions to create the financial arrangements to incentivise investment and grid connection. Admittedly, many Western countries achieved electrification for large populations from the 1950s to 1970s. So what’s distinctive about China’s experience?\nChina tackled rural electrification in two waves.\nThe first wave provided electricity to 97% of the population by the late 1990s. Extensions to the power grid carried electricity to about 80% of rural Chinese, while the rest gained access through small hydro and small coal-fired power plants (up to 50 megawatts) connected into local and regional grids.\nWinning the battle to bring electricity to the final 3% was much harder. Success came from China’s notable advances in extending and renovating rural grids.\nEven so, grid extensions could not reach everyone in a cost-effective manner.\nIn 2012, the central government issued a 3-year action plan, “Electricity for All (2013-2015)”1, to connect the final 2.73 million people. It succeeded. China declared full electrification in 2015."

    "section": "Experiences",
    "text": "Experiences\nWhat can the rest of the world learn? There are three lessons from China’s final, successful effort to electrify.\n\nCo-ordinate all stakeholders\nDespite prioritising electrification, the central government alone could neither implement the necessary investments, nor manage highly decentralised infrastructures. China’s central government therefore provided policy leadership and investment, but with extensive local coordination. Provincial governments examined local conditions and coordinated project implementation. Some conducted trials of different approaches and technologies, as the best strategies for ubiquitous electrification were not obvious.\nCentral government also sat at the centre of vital cost sharing schemes. For example, between 2013-2015 it allocated 24.8 billion yuan (approximately US$4 billion) for grid extensions and small off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Roughly 60%, or 14.6 billion yuan, came from central budgets. State-owned power companies and local governments provided the rest. Officials also used private firms to fund and implement PV projects. Central government investment sharing varied province-by-province, ranging from 20% to 80%. For instance, the poorest region involved was Tibet, where development projects are particularly expensive, so central government paid 80% of the costs, higher than average.\nWhat’s important to learn from the Chinese approach is the indispensable role of reliable funding, which in China’s case, came from the centre, along with the importance of guided experimentation and learning.\n\n\nSelect appropriate technologies\nThe final round of electrification was split 50/50 between grid extension and off-grid solar PV. Although more reliable, grid connection proved too expensive and inflexible for the remotest populations. Trials showed costs as high as 100,000 yuan (US$16,000) per household, depending on terrain and distance to the substation.\nDistributed solar PV at 0.5-1kW per household had better system reliability, but such micro-grids were also costly, averaging 9,000-20,000 yuan (US$1,400-3,200) per household.\nIndividual solar PV at 0.3-0.4kW per household was the cheapest option, costing between 7,500-11,200 yuan (US$1,200-1,800) per household. Generally, such systems were preferable, according to National Energy Administration guidelines, anywhere with less than 20 households per square kilometre. Grid systems were prohibitive yet households preferred their greater reliability and responsiveness to demand.\nConnecting the remotest households involves major trade-offs between power quality, level of supply and cost, though they may be lessened by continued improvements in remote off-grid systems.\nIn other countries, off-grid systems have faced the challenge of ongoing maintenance costs. China addressed this by covering them with the nationwide renewable energy fund. It collects 1.5 cents RMB (yuan) per kilowatt hour, rising to 1.9 cents RMB per kWh in 2016 to close the funding gap created by soaring renewable generation.\nIn areas that were prohibitive to serve with any system, the government rehoused people in more hospitable terrain.\n\n\nEmbed electrification in development plans\nAs in the US and other industrialised countries, China embedded electrification within its poverty eradication strategy, mainly through the “Infrastructure to Every Village Project,” which covered power, roads, water, and telecoms. Electrification facilitates rural economic growth, and higher incomes leads to greater electricity use, justifying further investment in rural electrification. This feedback loop enables sustainable electricity supplies rather than relying solely on government subsidy. Like the US, this process was hastened by policy measures such as China’s “home appliances to the countryside” programme, which subsidised purchases of TVs, washing machines, and mobile phones.\nOf course, there is also much about China that is different from other countries.\nChina’s authoritative central government can mobilise large amounts of capital relatively easily, and bring together state-owned power firms and local officials. Less authoritative governments can find those tasks more difficult. Moving people from isolated locations, for example, is not something all countries can do, and raises important questions about justice and people’s ability to adapt.\nNonetheless, while remembering differences and potential risks, China’s achievement offers lessons and blueprints. New technologies are rapidly making off-grid systems more viable, though grid systems remain the backbone. Continued improvements such as cheaper batteries and better systems integration, could shift the balance of economic merit to off-grid solutions.\nProviding electricity for all the world’s poorest is an ambitious goal. Careful planning and coordination between different stakeholders is needed to align the desired investment, human resources, and action plans.\nIntegrating electricity access into local economic development helps ensure more sustainable electrification. This is a key lesson from electrification of the advanced industrialised nations that China’s experience reinforces.\nThis article is adapted from He and Victor (2017) co-authored paper “Experiences and lessons from China’s success in providing electricity for all”, and presented at the 2017 IAEE International Conference at Singapore and 2017 EIA Energy Conference.\nCheck the original post at Dialogue Earth.

Various strategies of enhancing flexibility are under discussion to ensure the reliability of such a system, but no detailed quantitative analysis has been reported yet in China. We combine the advantages of a capacity expansion model, SWITCH-China, with a production simulation model, PLEXOS, and analyze flexibility options under different scenarios of a renewable-dominant power system in China. We find that a larger balancing area offers direct flexibility benefits. Regional balancing could reduce the renewable curtailment rate by 5–7%, compared with a provincial balancing strategy. National balancing could further reduce the power cost by about 16%. However, retrofitting coal power plants for flexible operation would only improve the system flexibility marginally."

Dean Sotiropoulos invited the participants to “envision the future of education and research in the era of intelligent machines.”\nKeynote speaker Jay Labov, former Senior Advisor for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, criticized current education practice in data science. He argued that too many students leave STEM majors because they do not find math formulas taught in class relevant to them. He said, “Most students would say ’I left STEM because it doesn’t speak to me. I thought I was going to be here, trying to help solve the world’s problems. What I find myself was in the classroom with five hundred undergraduates with a talking head in front putting up all kinds of equations that make no sense.”\nIn response, a panel, including Anand Rao (Data & Analytics PwC), Bonita London (Psychology SBU), Wei Zhu (Applied Math and Statistics SBU), and Nikki Evans (Director of Workforce Partnerships, CUNY), moderated by Marianna Savoca (Career Center SBU), presented their ideas to plug the leaky STEM pipeline through innovations in classroom teaching and industry-university partnerships.\nMinghua Zhang, Interim Provost of Stony Brook University, joined the workshop for lunch to welcome all participants and highlighted the challenges and uncertainties both in data collecting and data analyzing.\nIn the second keynote, Carrie Cullen Hitt, Executive Director of the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, illustrated how data science can improve efficiency in energy sectors by collecting and monitoring information generated, for instance, by wind turbines. Built on that premise, two panels further reviewed data science applications for clean energy and urban sustainability respectively. Panelists included: Vijay Modi (Columbia University), Vincent Guastamacchia (PSEG Long Island) led by Gang He (Technology and Society SBU), and Mark Rodgers (Rutgers Business School), Jeremy Schneider (The Alliance for Downtown NY), Omkar Aphale (Cascadia), Daniel Cisek (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), Katrina Sutton and Vaishnavi Karanam (UC Davis) moderated by Elizabeth Hewitt (Tech and Society SBU).\nAddressing data science misuse in the third keynote, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, unearthed hidden decisions involving ethical dilemmas that data scientists must make throughout their work pipeline, from data collection through insights generation. “We do make many implicit choices in every stage of the pipeline when we do the analysis. We don’t often think about whether these have any long-term consequences,” he said.\nThe final session, moderated by Wolf Schäfer (Technology and Society SBU), highlighted the need for ethics training in data science majors. In the panel, Derek Leben (University of Pittsburgh), Carl Hobert (author and conflict resolution expert), Robert Crease (Philosophy SBU), and Daniene Byrne (Technology and Society SBU) shared their work examining ethical decision process in data science and technology applications.\n— Firman Firmansyah"

    "text": "Abstract\nBattery storage is critical for integrating variable renewable generation, yet how the location, scale, and timing of storage deployment affect system costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is uncertain. We improve a power system model, SWITCH-China, to examine three nationally uniform battery deployment strategies (Renewable-connected, Grid-connected, and Demand-side) and a heterogeneous battery deployment strategy where each province is allowed to utilize any of the three battery strategies. Here, we find that the heterogeneous strategy always provides the lowest system costs among all four strategies, where provinces with abundant renewable resources dominantly adopt Renewable-connected batteries while those with limited renewables dominantly adopt Demand-side batteries. However, which strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions depends on carbon prices. The Renewable-connected strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions when carbon prices are relatively low, and the heterogeneous strategy results in the lowest CO2 emissions only at extremely high carbon prices."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIntegrating variable energy resources, notably solar and wind, requires better understanding of where, when and how much of variable resources are available. China’s ambitious solar energy development goal will be greatly facilitated by the resources assessment at higher spatial and temporal resolution. We utilized 10-year hourly solar irradiation data from 2001 to 2010 from 200 representative locations to develop provincial solar availability profiles. We found that China has a potential stationary solar capacity from 4700 GW to 39300 GW, distributed solar about 200 GW, and the annual solar output could reach 6900 TWh to 70100 TWh. Resources are most concentrated in northwest provinces, topped by Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Gansu. The challenge of solar development in China is integration rather than resources. The spatial and temporal variation of the solar resource show an efficient, robust, and inter-connected national grid and sound energy planning would be necessary to facilitate the integration of these vastly available but variable solar resources."

    "text": "Abstract\nDeep carbon mitigation and water resources conservation are two interacted environmental challenges that China’s power sector is facing. We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020–2050) of China’s power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10–20% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China’s water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario."

    "text": "I’m joining the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College, City University of New York, as an assistant professor on energy and climate policy.\n\nI’m grateful for Marxe School’s warm welcome messages in the August 2023 Faculty Spotlight.\n\n\nWe welcome Assistant Professor Gang He to the Marxe School and discuss his research, experiences, recent projects, two courses he will be teaching, and more.\nWelcome joining the Marxe School. Could you tell us more about your research?\nMy research focuses on using data-driven, evidence-based analysis to inform energy and climate policy, I call it DEEP policy research. My overall research goal is to enable a rapid, sustainable, resilient, and just energy transition to achieve carbon neutrality and address climate challenges. I have been developing my research on deep decarbonization pathways of the electric power sector, role and impacts of global clean energy supply chains, energy systems adaptation to climate change, and justice implications of energy transition. My work has been published in high-impact journals such as Nature, Nature Communications, One Earth, Environmental Science and Technology. Engaging in the policymaking process is crucial to me, as it allows for real-world impact. I have had the opportunity to testify for the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, offering insights before it become law. Additionally, I have advised the New York State Climate Action Council’s Scoping Plan. I’m excited to join the Marxe School and be surrounded by such a dynamic, diverse, and dedicated community of scholars and students. I’m eager to collaborate and contribute to the policy analysis, research, discussions, and debates aimed at fostering a better climate and society.\nWhat drew you to climate change policy?\nAs a first-generation college student and academic in my family, my journey began unexpectedly. When I was accepted into Peking University to study geography, I was working on a construction site. It was during my studies that I discovered my passion for geography, as it trained me to develop a systematic understanding of the big picture and allowed me to explore various places, people, and cultures through my fieldwork. During a project in southwest China, I observed firsthand the consequences of climate change. Due to increased rainfall and deforestation, the thin layer of topsoil is literally eroding from under the feet of local mountain residents, and with it their livelihoods. One event shaped my career trajectory significantly. After participating in the UN Climate Change Conference COP 11 in Montreal in 2005 as a youth delegate, I became increasingly involved in climate protection. I worked with fellow students and founded the first student climate club at Peking University, raising climate awareness among students and promoting environmental initiatives on campus. This experience propelled me to pursue a master’s degree in Climate and Society at Columbia University, followed by research work in the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University and a Ph.D. on Energy and Resources from the University of California, Berkeley. Over my lifetime, I have witnessed global annual carbon emissions double in forty years, reaching about 37 billion tons in 2021. Urgent actions are needed to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. I firmly believe that evidence-based policy can incentivize, leverage, and cultivate the necessary changes to achieve carbon neutrality.\nCan you share more about your ongoing research project on clean energy supply chain?\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, yet countries sometimes implement decoupling policies that might impede continuous cost declining. International climate policy and renewable energy deployment policy now face a crossroads: continue relying on global supply chains, or pivot towards domestic technology development and production. In a collaborative paper published in Nature, our research team found globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the United States, Germany, and China $67 Billion from 2008 to 2020, and solar prices would be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically. Build on the findings of the Nature paper, we are studying the carbon mitigation, air quality, and human health benefits of global solar PV supply chains, with support from the Global Energy Initiative at ClimateWorks Foundation. In addition, we are actively exploring opportunities and collaboration to address the challenges and implications to enable a sustainable, resilient, and just global clean energy supply chain to achieve climate goals.\nWhat will you be teaching in the Fall?\nThe urgent challenge of climate change demands innovative solutions and comprehensive policy frameworks. In the Fall 2023 semester, I will be teaching two courses focused on energy and climate change policy. The undergraduate course, “Energy, Climate, and Society”, takes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the science behind climate change, the complex technological and policy considerations, and the necessary pathways to transition towards a carbon-neutral future. The graduate-level course, “Energy and Climate Policy”, adopts a systems approach to delve into the essential policy questions and analytic tools necessary to achieve the energy transition required to address climate change. In both classes, we aim to inspire and equip students, especially those from underrepresented groups and underserved communities, to pursue careers in the energy and climate field. We strive to empower them with the knowledge and skills needed to make a positive impact on climate solutions."

I’m grateful for the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium 2022 Best Poster Award for online poster presentation.\nI’d like to take the opportunity to share the main messages of the paper. To achieve carbon neutrality, the world must embark on a rapid and massive deployment of renewable energy. However, certain decoupling policies that restrict the free flow of capital, talent, and innovation may delay the continuous reduction in costs of renewable energy. The international climate policy now faces a crossroads - to continue relying on global supply chains or to shift towards domestic technology development and production.\nOur research captures this policy dilemma and assesses the cost savings associated with a globalized solar PV module supply chain. We created a two-factor hybrid learning model that considers historical capacity, component, and input material prices of solar PV deployment from the United States, Germany, and China. The results show that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers $24 billion in the US, $7 billion in Germany and $36 billion in China from 2008 to 2020, compared to a scenario where domestic manufacturers increasingly supplied installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forward to 2030, we estimate that solar module prices will be about 20-30%2 higher than with a globalized supply chain. Our findings emphasize the importance of international cooperation in the pursuit of a low-carbon future."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nAs the world’s largest carbon emitter, China has committed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The power sector will play a pivotal role in meeting this target. However, due to the uneven distribution of renewable energy resources in China, the mature renewable energy sources, such as solar and onshore wind are located in the western and northwestern regions of China. The eastern coastal regions in China face significant challenges in decarbonizing their energy systems due to the absence of local renewable energy sources and high electricity demand. As electricity demand grows in the future, the gap between their local energy supply and high electricity needs will become more obvious. Rapid development of offshore wind power offers a promising solution to the decarbonization challenge in China’s coastal regions. Furthermore, the cost of offshore wind has decreased rapidly in recent years, making it economically feasible for large-scale deployment.\nBerkeley Lab and UC Berkeley conduct a new analysis, “Accelerating offshore wind development enhances energy independence and promotes carbon neutrality in China’s coastal regions.” This study is being conducted by Liqun Peng, Gang He, and Jiang Lin and explores the impacts of offshore wind development on the power generation, transmission networks in China’s power system and more importantly, energy independence of these coastal provinces. The analysis offers insights on what could be done to support offshore wind development to further accelerate power system transition and enhance energy self-sufficiency and economic development in the coastal provinces.\nJoin this webinar to find out more about our preliminary results, presented by Liqun Peng and Jiang Lin of Berkeley Lab, followed by feedback and comments from a panel of experts moderated by Prof. Gang He of CUNY-Baruch College, Michael O’Boyle from Energy Innovation, Yuan Bo from State Grid Energy Research Institute and Yujing Liu from RMI."

The persistence of the global production gap puts a well-managed and equitable energy transition at risk.\nGlobal levels of coal, oil , and gas estimated under the government plans and projections pathways would be 460%, 29%, and 82% higher than those under the respective 1.5°C-consistent pathways. The global levels of fossil fuel production implied by governments’ plans and projections, taken together, also exceed those implied by their stated climate mitigation policies and implied by their announced climate pledges as of September 2022, as modelled by the International Energy Agency.\nGiven risks and uncertainties of CCS and CDR, countries should aim for a near total phase-out of coal production and use by 2040 and a combined reduction in oil and gas production and use by three-quarters by 2050 from 2020 levels, at a minimum. The potential failure of these measures to become sufficiently viable at scale, the non-climatic near-term harms of fossil fuels, and other lines of evidence, call for an even more rapid global phase-out of all fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal levels of coal, oil , and gas estimated under the government plans and projections pathways would be 460%, 29%, and 82% higher than those under the respective 1.5°C-consistent pathways"

Increasing regulations on air pollution and carbon emissions and decreasing costs of renewables drive China’s transition away from coal; however, this transition also has implications for employment and social justice. Here, we assess China’s current coal-transition policies, their barriers, and the potential for an accelerated transition, as well as the associated environmental, human health, and employment and social justice issues that may arise from the transition. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway could reduce annual premature death related to coal combustion by 224,000 and reduce annual water consumption by 4.3 billion m3 in 2050 compared with business-as-usual. We highlight knowledge gaps and conclude with policy recommendations for an integrated approach to facilitate a rapid and just transition away from coal in China."

    "text": "SBU Press Release\n\nStudy Shows Huge Benefits of Transitioning Away from Coal in China\nAugust 21, 2020\nChina is the world’s largest producer and consumer of coal. A team of international scientists led by Stony Brook University’s Gang He, contend that China needs to transition away from coal to help the world achieve global decarbonization and improve the nation’s environmental and human health. In a perspective paper published in One Earth, the team outlines steps that can be taken for an albeit difficult, yet just and quicker transition away from coal.\nThe study proposes a political-socio-economic perspective targeting an integrated value chain to highlight a few overarching strategies and implementing policies accelerating China’s transition away from coal. This is different from the conventional discussion on coal transition, which usually centers on air pollution, carbon emission and competition from renewables.\n“Our paper is an effort to include in the overall discussion the employment and social justice impacts, including environmental justice, of such a transition,” said Dr. He, assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University.\n“The benefits of China’s transition away from coal is huge. We estimate that the most aggressive coal-transition pathway could reduce premature death related to coal combustion by 224,000 in 2050, compared to the business-as-usual scenario,” said Dr. He. “Similarly, our maximum estimated reduction in water consumption, arguably the most vital of all resources, is about 4.3 billion m3 in 2050.”\nThe researchers argue that for a rapid transition away from coal, China needs to take these steps:\n\nRetire coal generating plants earlier and cancel newly planned coal projects.\nReduce the nation’s coal consumption beyond the massive power sector.\nA rapid transition presents economic and social challenges that should be met with new economic opportunities.\nAttempt to align the motivations and incentives of key business and government stakeholders, which are often not coordinated.\n\nDr. He emphasizes that a successful coal transition would involve changes that must take into account the well-being and economic security of some three million people who work in coal mining-related jobs in China, as well as another 500,000 who work within the coal power industry. A just transition away from coal, the authors write, also needs to accommodate low-income groups that rely on abundant, cheap and readily available coal for basic electricity and heating service.\nTo start the transition, the authors propose the creation of a dedicated task force charged with facilitating action plans to be carried out and a process that serves the best interests of affected stakeholders and China’s diverse population."

    "text": "Challenges\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, a process that relies on an efficient global clean energy supply chain. Based on the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050, solar and wind energy deployment must reach 20 and 15 times their 2020 levels by 2050, respectively, to bring down global energy-related carbon emissions to net zero. The global supply chains for solar and wind, intertwined with critical minerals and storage technologies, play a pivotal role in the success of this transition.\nToday, however, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate-driven events, present significant risks to the stability of the global clean energy supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of global supply chains, disrupting manufacturing, transportation, and distribution networks worldwide. Geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts add another layer of complexity. The trade war has disrupted the free flow of capital, products, and even talents, essential components for the supply chain. Additionally, climate-induced extreme weather events and natural disasters pose physical threats to the infrastructure of the supply chain, affecting both production and distribution.\nThe unequal distribution of costs and benefits along the supply chain raises ethical and socio-economic concerns, sometimes leading to countries breaking from the supply chain. While some regions benefit economically from the growth of the renewable energy sector, other regions bear disproportionate environmental and social burdens, particularly in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The extraction of critical minerals, essential for battery manufacturing, often occurs in these regions, leading to environmental degradation, exploitation of local communities, and insufficient sharing of economic benefits. Deep seabed mining, promoted by some, presents an added layer of ecosystem risks."

    "text": "Benefits\nDespite these challenges, the benefits of a global supply chain are massive. An efficient and resilient supply chain is crucial for achieving continued cost reductions in solar, wind, and storage technologies – a key factor to scale up deployment. A paper published in Nature, Helveston, He, and Davidson (2022) show solar PV costs could be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move from global supply chain to manufacturing domestically. The interconnectedness of these technologies, facilitated by a global supply chain, not only aids in cost reduction but also plays a pivotal role in carbon mitigation, pollution reduction, and overall improvement of human health. A recent paper published in Communications Earth & Environment, Chen et al. (2023) found that coordination of global solar manufacturing at low carbon regions and prioritize installation at carbon intensive regions could achieve 97.5 Gt more net carbon dioxide mitigation from 2020 to 2060. These benefits underscore the importance of preserving and strengthening the global supply chain, even as we navigate the challenges it presents."

Such a framework would bring together stakeholders from all countries and diverse sectors, fostering understanding and collaboration. This collaborative approach is essential for advancing solutions that continue to harness the benefits of a global supply chain while effectively addressing concerns about the associated risks and uncertainties.\nA just, resilient, and sustainable framework for the clean energy supply chain needs to consider the specific challenges faced by different regions, especially in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. In these regions, the risks from supply chain disruptions are exacerbated by pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities. The pandemic has highlighted the need for robust public health infrastructure, social safety nets, and resilient economic systems. Geopolitical tensions can disproportionately affect developing nations, disrupting their economic development and access to crucial clean technologies. Climate events can have severe consequences in regions that are already overburdened with the impacts of climate change, leading to a compounding of challenges."

    "section": "A multi-faceted approach",
    "text": "A multi-faceted approach\nAddressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that combines international cooperation, targeted policy interventions, and technological innovation.\nFirstly, international cooperation is essential to facilitate such a clean energy supply chain. Diplomatic efforts should be made to de-escalate trade tensions and foster collaboration between nations. Additionally, a global framework for the ethical and sustainable mining of critical minerals is crucial. This framework should ensure that mineral extraction respects environmental standards, labor conditions, and local communities’ well-being.\nSecondly, policy interventions at both national and international levels are vital to create a just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain. Governments need to implement policies that promote transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in the renewable energy sector. This includes establishing clear guidelines for ethical supply chain practices, incentivizing sustainable mining of critical minerals, and ensuring that the benefits of the renewable energy transition are shared equitably. International organizations can play a pivotal role in facilitating dialogue, setting standards, and providing support for developing nations to strengthen their renewable energy infrastructure and institutions.\nThirdly, technological innovation is key to mitigating risks associated with the clean energy supply chain. Research and development efforts should focus on alternative materials that reduce dependence on critical minerals, recycling technologies to recover valuable components from end-of-life solar panels, wind turbines, and battery packs. Investing in innovative solutions will not only address the current challenges but also future-proof the clean energy supply chain against emerging risks.\nIn crafting a just, resilient, and sustainable framework, it is crucial to consider the social and environmental impact of the supply chain at every stage. This includes the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing processes, transportation, distribution, installation, operation, and end-of-life disposal. Transparency and standards can ensure accountability and enable consumers, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions that align with ethical and sustainability considerations.\nFurthermore, a just framework should prioritize the empowerment of local communities and workers involved in the clean energy supply chain. This involves fostering skill development, creating job opportunities, and ensuring fair wages and working conditions. Community engagement should be a cornerstone of supply chain and clean energy investments and projects, allowing local residents to actively participate in decision-making processes and share the benefits of renewable energy development.\nIn conclusion, the global clean energy supply chain stands at a critical intersection of immense benefits and pressing challenges. While it is a linchpin for achieving global climate goals, its vulnerabilities to disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and unequal distribution of costs and benefits cannot be ignored. Creating a just, resilient, and sustainable framework for the clean energy supply chain is not only an ethical imperative but also a pragmatic necessity. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are realized globally, leaving no one behind in the clean energy transition to achieve climate goals.\nCheck the original post at ClimateWorks Foundation, and the Chinese version here.\n\nReferences\n\n\nChen, Shi, Xi Lu, Chris P.

    "text": "Abstract\nChina is pursuing the development of low-carbon eco-cities to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions; however, it is unclear what constitutes a low-carbon eco-city and how to evaluate it. The eco and low-carbon indicator tool for evaluating cities (ELITE cities) was developed by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2012 to evaluate cities’ performance by comparing them against benchmark performance goals as well as rank them against other cities in China. ELITE cities measures progress on 33 key indicators selected to represent priority issues within eight primary categories. An excel-based tool was then developed to package the key indicators, indicator benchmarks, explanation of indicators, point calculation functions and transparency-oriented data recording instructions. ELITE cities could be a useful and effective tool for local city government in defining the broad outlines of a low-carbon eco-city and assessing the progress of cities’ efforts towards this goal. ELITE cities can also be used by higher-level governments to assess city performance and discern best practices. This paper explains the general framework of the ELITE cities tool, the methods by which the indicators and indicator benchmarks were established, and a detailed guide on tool applications."

    "text": "SBU News\n\nThe five-year contract is with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Division of Materials Management. The project is led by Principal Investigators (PI) Professors David Tonjes and Elizabeth Hewitt, Co-PI Professor Gang He, and Research Professor Krista Thyberg. The primary task is to sample a set of municipal waste systems statewide to determine the composition of managed wastes and recyclables.\nProfessor Tonjes has worked on New York solid waste issues for 30 years, in both technical and policy applications. Professor Hewitt is a planner with a strong background in researching human behavior and motivations in environmental settings. Professor He has conducted extensive research on recent energy and environmental management in China in terms of both infrastructure and policy changes. Professor Thyberg has been working on solid waste issues for about 10 years, including iconic work on managing food waste. They will be supported by teams of graduate students enrolled in doctoral and masters programs in the Department, and undergraduate students drawn mostly from the Technological Systems Management major.\nStudent teams get the job of sorting garbage into more than 20 categories to determine variations across the State and within different kinds of management programs. Data will provide characterizations at a variety of scales, from individual truck routes to the State as a whole. The first year’s work, which was impacted by the pandemic, was restricted to sorting wastes at a number of recycling facilities and at two Long Island locations. The students found time during lock down to assemble data from nearly 200 waste sorts done by others across the country over the past several decades to put the New York work into context.\n“Similarities and differences across data sets will help refine State policies and regulations regarding solid waste management,” said Tonjes, associate research professor in the Department of Technology & Society in Stony Brook’s College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS). “Our ultimate goal is to enable municipal waste managers to better target recovery and other management efforts while leading to refined or new means to promote more environmentally favorable behaviors.”\nThis summer the sampling teams will fan out across the State and analyze samples at a number of disposal and recycling facilities. The data will not only be used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of current programs but also to support other NYSDEC-funded recycling research programs, including work at the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute in Rochester, the University at Buffalo, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Alfred University.\nYear one also saw the completion of other related research projects supported by the NYSDEC grant by two smaller teams of student researchers:\n\nThe first created an interactive web-based model to allow local planners to determine which materials are economically favored for recycling. This will allow for potential expansion of municipal recycling menus in sustainable directions. The model has been created and tested, and now the project report is being finalized for release later this spring.\nThe second project investigated the interplay between market specifications and economics, recycling facility engineering choices, and policies adopted in China and by other jurisdictions that affect recycling. In 2017-2018, these factors merged to catastrophically collapse global recyclables markets. This research has explored the drivers for these intertwined forces and will help those proposing recycling regulations and planning technology implementations to mitigate the potential for similar events, and potentially to provide direction for recyclables processing for more long-term market sustainability. The reports detailing the findings are being prepared and will also be available in Spring 2021.\nA third related recycling research project will analyze the principles of the “circular economy” and determine the potential for recycling (especially “first order” recycling, which is when old newspaper is turned into new newspaper, not toilet paper, for instance) to play an important role in creating sustainable materials management. The project will focus on the classic set of recyclable materials (newspaper, cardboard, glass, metals, plastics) to determine what kinds of factors may limit first order recycling, which can lead to better expectations for market development and pursuit of innovative uses of collected materials destined for reuse. This project has just started and is expected to take two years to complete.\n\n“The Department of Technology & Society blends engineering principles with social responsibility to help ensure that advances in technology truly benefit the community,” said Robert Kukta, acting dean, CEAS. “With population growth and increasing waste production, effective recycling is a critical issue for global sustainability. This project is a large step in the right direction not only for New York, but as a model for other locales.”"

    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, yet countries sometimes implement policies that increase costs by restricting the free flow of capital, talent and innovation in favour of localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment and trade surpluses. Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19–31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5–9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26–45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario where domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20–30 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.\n\n\n\nComparison of estimated solar PV module prices under global versus national market scenarios in China (2007–2020), and Germany and the United States (2006–2020)."

China’s CO2 emissions reductions have been substantial by 2020, carbon intensity decreased by 48.4 percent compared to 2005 levels, achieving objectives outlined in the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions and Nationally Determined Contributions. These reductions rely on the achievements of sectoral and sub-national targets outlined by China’s Five-Year Plans. However, China still faces the challenges of reaching its peak total CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. Key steps towards China’s carbon neutrality include increasing its non-fossil energy share, deploying negative-emission technologies at large scale, promoting regional low-carbon development and establishing a nationwide ‘green market’. To achieve these steps, top-down socio-economic development plans must coincide with bottom-up economic incentives and technology development."

    "text": "Background\nThe costs for solar, wind and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010 and are expected to decline further in the near future. This rapid fall in costs could have a large effect on energy system investment and policies, but has not been fully captured in energy modelling.\nThis is particularly relevant for China, which is now debating whether to build hundreds of new coal-fired power plants in the 2020s, despite overcapacity and financial distress in the sector.\nIn a new study, published in Nature Communications, we worked with my colleagues to explore the implications of clean-energy cost trends for the electricity system in China over the next decade.\nWe found that if China uses the most cost-effective renewable energy resources, it could generate more than 60% of its electricity from “non-fossil” sources by 2030 – including wind, solar, hydro and nuclear – at a cost that is around 10% lower than under business-as-usual.\nThis cleaner electricity mix would still reliably meet rising demand. This suggests China could raise its target to get 50% of its electricity from non-fossil sources by 2030, while saving money."

    "text": "Balancing priorities\nIt is often said that renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar, are variable and expensive. However, the recent innovation in technology and operation of electricity grids – and, in particular, the availability of cheaper storage – have changed the industry outlook.\nIn this study, we used an electricity system capacity expansion model (SWITCH-China) to explore how the Chinese power system could be expanded to meet rising electricity demand. We developed four scenarios for 2030 to explore the implications of a continued, rapid decrease in renewable energy costs.\nThe scenarios are:\n\nBusiness-as-usual scenario (BAU), which assumes the continuation of current policies and moderate cost decreases in future renewable costs;\nLow-cost renewables scenario (R), which assumes the rapid recent decrease in costs for renewables and storage will continue;\nCarbon constraints scenario (C50), which has a power-sector carbon cap of 50% below 2015 levels in 2030, on top of the R scenario;\nDeep carbon constraints scenario (C80), which further constrain the carbon emissions from the power sector to be 80% lower than the 2015 level by 2030.\n\nAll scenarios assume the same electricity demand projection, which reaches 8,757 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2030, up from 7,225TWh today.\nOur modeling results show that, as expected, rapid decreases in the costs of renewable energy sources lead to more wind and solar capacity being installed. If the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for solar, wind and storage follows recent global trends then, by 2030, China could meet expected demand with 62% of its electricity from non-fossil sources under the R scenario with the lowest overall cost.\nThis “R” scenario is shown in Figure 1, in the second column on the right-hand side, with wind (green) and solar (yellow) providing 39% of the total. As a result of higher non-fossil output, coal-based generation (black) could be just 3,700TWh in 2030 under the R scenario, some 30% lower than under BAU (4,900TWh). Battery storage (orange) and small amounts of gas (purple) generation would supplement the increasing wind and solar supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Electricity generation by fuel, terawatt hours, in 2020 (left), 2025 (centre) and 2030 (right), under each of the four modelled scenarios.

Figure 2 shows the capacity of each source, in gigawatts (GW), under the four scenarios.\nBy 2030, wind and solar capacity would reach 660GW and 1,260GW under the “R” scenario, respectively.

In our scenarios, it is estimated to reach up to 130GW by 2030, with the remaining 177GW coming from battery storage or other storage technology.\nThis large capacity would be very ambitious to deploy in a comparatively short time, requiring about 11.8GW annually during the period we modelled. If battery efficiency and performance were to improve more quickly than we assumed, the needed storage capacity would be smaller."

As a result, the implied cost of carbon reduction would be -$36 per tonne of CO2. Even under the carbon cap (C50) scenario, China could eliminate half of its 2015 emissions from the power sector by 2030 at 6% lower cost, while delivering 77% of electricity from non-fossil sources."

This would have co-benefits including reducing harmful air pollution, cutting water use and creating green jobs.\nIn contrast, there are signs that some local governments are fast-tracking more new coal power plants this year, despite the fact that half of China’s existing capacity is already losing money and the entire fleet only operates half the time, a sign of overcapacity.\nWhile it should save money overall, the scale of the transformation implied by our work is significant and would require a very rapid acceleration of current progress. The capacity of renewables and storages, as well as transmission infrastructure, would need to be scaled up very quickly.\nNevertheless, our analysis shows that such a fast decarbonisation and clean power transition is both technically feasible and economically beneficial.\nOptions to bring such a transition about could include long-term targets for clean energy, such as a zero-emission power target, as well as electricity market reforms. This could create incentives to reduce institutional barriers to trading power across regions and to better integrate renewable energy.\nCheck the original post at Carbon Brief.

Over the past two decades, China has been the main country to substantially and consistently expand its nuclear fleet. Here we compiled and analyzed a dataset on the construction costs of nuclear power plants in China. We find that the construction costs of Chinese nuclear power plants have been declining since 2000, and the cost of building a nuclear power plant has been halved. China’s deliberate, staged effort to build domestic supply chains and standardized reactor designs has been key to this success. Coordinated regulatory structures and long-term policy commitments have also been important. As countries rush to expand nuclear capacities, they must combine affordability with safety, scalability, investor confidence and public trust. Without this, nuclear power will remain an expensive bet the world can ill afford.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Overnight construction costs of commercial nuclear power units in the US, France, and China.

They attribute this success to a strategic blend of stable regulations, domestic supply chain development, and standardized reactor designs. China’s centralized nuclear regulatory structure, long-term policy commitments, and rapid project execution have enabled it to build reactors in nearly half the time of recent Western counterparts. These findings have important implications for policymakers seeking a nuclear energy resurgence, “As countries rush to expand nuclear capacities, they must combine affordability with safety, scalability, investor confidence and public trust. Without this, nuclear power will remain an expensive bet the world can ill afford”, they conclude."

Although growing literature has reported green job opportunities (e.g., solar technicians) as a potential solution to the displacement of coal sector workers, the extent to which green jobs are easily accessible, regarding co-location and skill requirements, remains unclear. Here, we explore this issue in the context of China’s coal phaseout toward the 2060 carbon neutrality target. Using a coal power plant retirement model of 3,765 coal power units, we find that coal power plant workers must travel long distances (178–242 km) to reach a green job site. When further considering job skill qualifications, in total, fewer than 15% of these workers can easily access green jobs. Postponing the coal phaseout might further exacerbate the job transition challenge. Upstream industries of the renewable energy sector (e.g., electrical machinery), which can be located closer to coal power plants and have better job skill matching, can help alleviate the challenging prospect.\n\n\n\nSpatial relation and skill similarity between coal power plant workers and green jobs"

I appreciate the attention your committee is giving to the vital issues of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and clean energy.\nI’m an assistant professor in the Department of Technology and Society at Stony Brook University. My research focuses on energy system modeling, energy economic, energy and climate policy.\n\n\nRenewable energy is achieving global momentum\nThe costs of solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, and battery storage have fallen by approximately 65% to 85% since 2010 and are projected to decline further in the near future—creating opportunities for deep decarbonization in the power sector and energy systems. According to the latest report from Green Tech Media Research, U.S. Residential Solar Economic Outlook: Grid Parity, Rate Design and Net Metering Risk, 20 U.S. states are currently at grid parity, including in New York.\n\n\nNew York’s opportunity to keep leadership in clean energy and climate action\nNew York State has an opportunity to lead in clean energy and climate action by introducing and implementing the renewable energy development and carbon mitigation targets. California, for example, is on the path and pace to achieve goals to reduce GHG to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, benefit from a series of supporting policies1, including:\n\nA renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) to increase renewable electricity production to 60% by 2030;\n\nA low-carbon fuel standard to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 20 percent by 2030;\n\nAnd efficiency standards in building, appliance, water and others to double energy efficiency savings at existing buildings;\n\nSuite of other energy and climate policies to facilitate the transition.\n\nIn addition to California, New Jersey (50 percent by 2030), Connecticut (40 percent by 2030) and Massachusetts (35 percent by 2030) all adopted stronger targets for renewable energy, accelerating their states’ transitions away from fossil fuels and toward to a clean energy future. New York State has to choose to lead, or fall behind.\n\n\nGreen jobs and economic benefits\nSuch clean energy transition is not only generating renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, but also creating jobs and economic benefits to New York State and local communities. My research group has worked with the offshore wind industry, to estimate the jobs and economic impact of offshore wind projects in New York State. We estimated that a typical 800MW offshore wind project could create more than 3000 direct and indirect clean full-time equivalent energy jobs and bring nearly 700 million economic impact to the New York State. About 40 percent of the jobs will be in Long Island area. Work in the Long Island region includes cable and converter station connections, and work on the onshore substation. There will also jobs related R&D spending, and community development.\n\n\nPaving the road for 21st century economic competitiveness\nEnergy technology innovation, together with other emerging technologies such as AI, big data, internet of things, block chain, and their applications to clean energy sector, are building the next frontiers of economic development and competition. The clean energy workforce, and the education of next generation energy leaders are the new pillars to support a sustainable future for New York State.\nThe key message I’d like to share is that leadership in clean energy development and climate action present an economic opportunity for New York State. The job creation and economic benefits through clean energy innovation and investment is a true opportunity, and New York could harvest those benefit as an earlier mover.\nThe transcprit is also available in pdf."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn 2015 China provided access to electricity to its entire population—the first of the large emerging and developing countries to achieve that landmark goal that most advanced industrialized countries met decades earlier. We found some key experiences and lessons to be learned from China’s successful program to provide electricity for all. Substantial funding from the central government, delivered by mechanisms sensitive to local provincial needs, were essential to success. Also vital was use of off-grid solar home systems for the most remote users for whom grid connection would be quite costly."

This panel brings together three papers offering comprehensive insights into the assessment, politics, and policy responses to climate change impacts. Paper 1 examines the effects of climate change on the supply-demand match (SDM) in global wind and solar energy systems. Using state-of-the-art climate models, the paper reveals significant reductions in SDM across various regions by the end of the century, emphasizing the need for early adaptation measures in the energy sector. Paper 2 assesses the effectiveness of current conservation projects and funding allocation in meeting the water needs of the Colorado River Basin, particularly in light of ongoing droughts and climate change. Analyzed 593 projects across thirteen programs, the paper shows that while the majority of funds went to municipal projects, it did not result in high amounts of estimated water savings compared to other categories. Paper 3 studies urban stormwater flooding and policy solutions, focusing on marginalized populations in Chicago. Through socio-institutional network analysis and economic assessments, the paper highlights the importance of coordinated efforts at both local and national levels to address flooding disparities and integrate green infrastructure for sustainable urban development. Paper 4 investigates the carbon emission reduction effect of green financial policies in China. By analyzing data from green finance reform and innovation pilot cities, the paper uncovers significant reductions in carbon emission intensity, particularly through industrial structure optimization and green technology innovation, with regional variations in policy effectiveness.

    "text": "Full Response\nQ: China, as we know has a long-term plan to increase the proportion of nuclear energy into its energy mix. What are the advantages and risks of such ambition?\nA: Energy strategy and policy are about trade-offs and fit in specific conditions and constraints. The political economy dynamics of different energy technologies will have a large impact on the outcomes.\nFrom my research, China’s future power system will be quite sensitive to how much nuclear can China put online. I have seen 2050 nuclear projections and plans range from about 300GW to 500GW, this 200GW differences will need about 800-1000GW more wind and solar capacity to fill the gap, as nuclear plants can run at 90% capacity factor with little or no impact from weather. However, if China manages to accelerate the expansion and integration of solar, wind, and other renewables, then the need for nuclear will be reduced to its lower end, with less pressure on nuclear risks and nuclear waste management.\nWe will see renewables and nuclear expand hand in hand in the short term to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality in the medium and long-term, but the comparative scale will be shaped by the changing political economy of those technologies."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe clean development mechanism (CDM) has been a leading international carbon market and a driving force for sustainable development. But the eruption of controversy over offsets from Chinese wind power in 2009 exposed cracks at the core of how carbon credits are verified in the developing economies. The Chinese wind controversy therefore has direct implications for the design and negotiation of any successor to the Kyoto Protocol or future market-based carbon regimes. In order for carbon markets to avoid controversy and function effectively, the lessons from the Chinese wind controversy should be used to implement key reforms in current and future carbon policy design. The paper examines the application of additionality in the Chinese wind power market and draws implications for the design of effective global carbon offset policy. It demonstrates the causes of the wind power controversy, highlights underlying structural flaws, in how additionality is applied in China, the Offsetters’ Paradox, and charts a reform path that can strengthen the credibility of global carbon markets.\n\n\n\nThe Offsetters’ Paradox: if credits are given for the difference between BAU1 and target trajectories, any domestic policy that lowers baseline emissions to create BAU2 reduces carbon payments, and therefore disincentivizes domestic emissions-reducing policies that would shift BAU1 to BAU2."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change modulates both energy demand and wind/solar energy supply, but a globally synthetic analysis of supply-demand match (SDM) is lacking. Here we use 12 state-of-the-art climate models to assess climate change impacts on SDM, quantified by the fraction of demand met by local wind or solar supply. For energy systems with varying dependence on wind or solar supply, up to 32% or 44% of non-Antarctic land areas, respectively, are projected to experience robust SDM reductions by the end of this century under an intermediate emission scenario. Smaller and more variable supply reduces SDM at northern middle-to-high latitudes, whereas reduced heating demand alleviates or reverses SDM reductions remarkably. By contrast, despite supply increases somewhere at low latitudes, raised cooling demand reduces SDM substantially. Changes in climate extremes and climate mean make size-comparable contributions. Our results provide early warnings for energy sectors in climate change adaptation."

By doing this, you only need to update a single source file, and then rerender the site to reflect changes across all pages.\n\"{{&lt; include _statement.qmd &gt;}}\"\nPrefixing include file names with an underscore (“_“) ensures they won’t be rendered directly by Quarto.\nHere is an example course description, and reuse it in mainpage and syllabus.\n\n\nAcademic badges\nDisplay academic badges like the Dimension Citation badge and Altmetric badge.\n\nHere’s an example for embedding them:\n&lt;span class=\"__dimensions_badge_embed__\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-style=\"large_rectangle\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-badge-popover=\"right\" data-badge-type=\"1\" data-doi=\"10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6\" data-hide-no-mentions=\"true\" class=\"altmetric-embed\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nReplace the doi with your own.\nMake sure to include below scripts in the same page to enable the badges:\n&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script async src=\"https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nYou can also showcase your highly cited and hot papers using custom badges.\n \n![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/highly-cited-paper-badge.png \"ESI Highly Cited Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Highly cited paper\"} ![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/hot-paper-badge.png \"ESI Hot Paper\"){width=20 fig-alt=\"Hot paper\"}\nHere is an example, and the source code.\n\n\nSocial sharing\nFor easy setup of social sharing buttons, AddToAny is a simple solution.\nUsing includes files here will make it easier to manage updates, as any changes to social buttons need only be made once.\nHere is an example.\n\n\nThe art of listing\nListings are a powerful tool in Quarto, offering flexibility for creating visually appealing and organized pages. By adjusting listing options, you can control how content is presented.\nType: default, grid, table\nOptions: grid-columns, image-height, grid-item-align\nDisplay: fields and field-display-names\nBy mastering these options, you can easily create pages that fit your content needs while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.\nHere is an example, and source code; another example, and source code.\n\n\nListing specific categories\nTo display a subset of items, use the include and exclude options. Below is an example of listing publications by category:\n  content:\n    - publications.yml\n  include:\n    categories: \"supply-chain\"\nHere, publications.yml is a YAML file containing a list of publications with predfined categories, and categories is the key used for filtering. The result will display only publications that match the specified category.\nHere is an example, and source code.\n\n\nListing external items\nTo list external resources with key metadata, you can use this format to create clear, linked listings.\n    - path: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6\n      image: /files/images/journal/nature.avif\n      title: \"Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains\"\n      subtitle: \"*Nature*\"\n      description: \"Globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the U.S., Germany, and China $67B 2008-2020, and solar prices will be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically.\"\n      date: \"2022-10-26\"\nFor efficiency, store multiple items in a YAML(.yml) file and reference it in Quarto.\nHere is an example, and source code.\n\n\nExporting Quarto Revealjs slides to PDF\nRevealjs’s default PDF Export omits footnotes, which is not acceptable if citations and sources are used. A workaround is to use decktape:\ndecktape automatic lecture1.html lecture1.pdf\nIf you encounter font error when opening the PDF:\n\n“Cannot extract the embedded font ‘BAAAAA+SourceSansPro-Regular’. Some characters may not display or print correctly.”\n\nUse Adobe Acrobat tools to fix it:\n\nOpen the PDF in Adobe Acrobat.\nGo to Use print production &gt; Preflight &gt; Analyze and fix it (default options).\nApply the necessary font correction."

    "text": "Abstract\nGlobal supply chains have played a central role in driving down solar photovoltaic (PV) costs and accelerating deployment globally, but their broader societal benefits are underexplored. Here we quantify the climate, air quality, and health impacts of imported solar panels in the United States between 2014 and 2022. We find that 1 kW of imported solar capacity yields an average of $180 in annualized climate and health benefits, offsetting nearly half the PV module cost in 2020. This imported capacity displaced fossil generation by 305 TWh, avoided 178 million tons of CO₂, and prevented an estimated 595 premature deaths between 2014 and 2022. While these advantages are unevenly distributed across regions and demographic groups, residents in non-importing states also benefited from them. These findings provide critical evidence for policy debates on clean energy trade, showing that imported solar capacity delivers substantial public health and climate gains beyond direct cost savings.\n\n\n\nAvoided emissions and PM2.5-related health benefits associated with electricity generation from imported solar panels"

    "text": "Main findings\n\n\nSince the 2023 analysis, governments now plan even higher levels of coal production to 2035 and gas production to 2050. Planned oil production continues to increase to 2050.\nTo meet Paris Agreement goals of holding warming to well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, the world must now undertake steeper and faster reductions in fossil fuel production to compensate for lack of progress so far. Meanwhile, governments expanding fossil fuel infrastructure waste public funds on development destined to become stranded assets.\nAchieving these reductions will require deliberate, coordinated policies to ensure a just transition away from fossil fuels. While a few major fossil-fuel-producing countries have begun to align production plans with national and international climate goals, most still have not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increases in fossil fuel production estimated under the government plans and projections pathways would lead to global production levels in 2030 that are 500%, 31%, and 92% higher for coal, oil, and gas, respectively, than the median 1.5ºC-con­sistent pathway. These plans and projections also collectively exceed the fossil fuel production implied by countries’ own climate mitigation pledges by 35% in 2030 and 141% in 2050."
