## Position Overview

We are seeking a highly motivated post-doctoral researcher to join our interdisciplinary team studying the carbon mitigation, air quality, and human health benefits of global clean energy supply chains, with support from the Global Energy Initiative at ClimateWorks Foundation. The ideal candidate will have expertise in power system modeling, air pollution and human health modeling.

## Key Responsibilities

*   Conduct research on the carbon mitigation, air quality, and human health benefits of global clean energy supply chains using power system modeling, air pollution modeling, and human health modeling.  
*   Develop and apply power system models to evaluate the impacts of clean energy supply chains on electricity systems and greenhouse gas emissions.  
*	Develop and apply air pollution and human health models to evaluate the impacts of clean energy supply chains on air quality and human health.  
*	Collaborate with interdisciplinary team members and external partners to ensure project goals are met.  
*	Publish research findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at conferences.  
*	Contribute to the preparation of grant proposals and other funding opportunities.  

## Requirements

*	PhD in a relevant field, such as energy systems, electrical engineering, environmental science, or public health.  
*	Expertise in power system modeling (e.g., SWITCH, PyPSA, GridPath, GenX), air pollution modeling (e.g., CMAQ, WRF-Chem, or inMAP), and human health modeling.  
*	Proficiency in at least one programming language commonly used for system modeling (e.g., Python, R, or MATLAB).  
*	Strong analytical skills and experience with statistical analysis.
*	Excellent oral and written communication skills.  
*	Ability to work independently and as part of a team.  
*	Track record of publishing research findings in peer-reviewed journals.  

## Preferred qualifications

*	Experience working on interdisciplinary research projects.  
*	Familiarity with global supply chains and sustainability issues.  
*	Experience with spatial analysis and GIS software (e.g., ArcGIS or QGIS).  

This is a full-time, one-year position with the possibility of extension based on performance and funding availability. The position offers salary and benefits package, as well as opportunities for professional development and networking. Applicants should submit a CV, cover letter, and contact information for three references. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the position is filled.
