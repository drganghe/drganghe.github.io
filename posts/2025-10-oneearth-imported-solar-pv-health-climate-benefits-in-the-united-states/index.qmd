## Abstract

Global supply chains have played a central role in driving down solar photovoltaic (PV) costs and accelerating deployment globally, but their broader societal benefits are underexplored. Here we quantify the climate, air quality, and health impacts of imported solar panels in the United States between 2014 and 2022. We find that 1 kW of imported solar capacity yields an average of $180 in annualized climate and health benefits, offsetting nearly half the PV module cost in 2020. This imported capacity displaced fossil generation by 305 TWh, avoided 178 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, and prevented an estimated 595 premature deaths between 2014 and 2022. While these advantages are unevenly distributed across regions and demographic groups, residents in non-importing states also benefited from them. These findings provide critical evidence for policy debates on clean energy trade, showing that imported solar capacity delivers substantial public health and climate gains beyond direct cost savings.
