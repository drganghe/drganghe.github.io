## Title

Role of Global Clean Energy Supply Chains in Achieving Climate Goals        


## Speaker

HE Gang, Baruch College, City University of New York


## Abstract

Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, a process that relies on an efficient global clean energy supply chain. However, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate-driven events, present significant risks to the stability of the global clean energy supply chains. This talk will discuss the changing landscape and evolving debate over global clean energy supply chain, by analyzing the costs implication, carbon savings, air pollution and human health benefits of global clean energy supply chain, using solar PV as an example. In addressing these challenges and maximizing the benefits, there is a pressing need for a commonly agreed framework for a just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain.
