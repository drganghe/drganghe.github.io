## Summary

Achieving China’s ambitious long-term climate goals will require fundamental transformations to the power sector. Many techno-economic uncertainties remain which will shape the pace and structure of this trajectory, including the costs of alternative energies, demand growth and electrification, flexibility of conventional generators, and deployment of firm low-carbon resources. In addition, policy evolution in the power sector, including provincial and regional electricity market developments and inter-provincial coordination, will have a large impact on which resources are selected and how they are operated. Open modeling efforts have been engaging with more open-source datasets, which if properly validated could provide a common framework for understanding the key features driving system evolution.
