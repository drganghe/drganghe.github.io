## Abstract

In 2015 China provided access to electricity to its entire population—the first of the large emerging and developing countries to achieve that landmark goal that most advanced industrialized countries met decades earlier. We found some key experiences and lessons to be learned from China’s successful program to provide electricity for all. Substantial funding from the central government, delivered by mechanisms sensitive to local provincial needs, were essential to success. Also vital was use of off-grid solar home systems for the most remote users for whom grid connection would be quite costly.
