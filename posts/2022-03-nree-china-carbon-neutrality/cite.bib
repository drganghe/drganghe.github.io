	abstract = {China is currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide ({CO}2). China therefore has a key role in global climate change mitigation. Policies and commitments are required to enable decarbonization. In this Perspective, we summarize the key features of China’s {CO}2 emissions, its reduction processes and successes in meeting climate targets. China’s {CO}2 emissions reductions have been substantial: by 2020, carbon intensity decreased by 48.4\% compared to 2005 levels, achieving objectives outlined in the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions and Nationally Determined Contributions. These reductions rely on the achievements of sectoral and sub-n ational targets outlined by China’s Five-Y ear Plans. However, China still faces the challenges of reaching its peak total {CO}2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. Key steps towards China’s carbon neutrality include increasing its non-fossil energy share, deploying negative-emission technologies at large scale, promoting regional low-carbon development and establishing a nationwide ‘green market’. To achieve these steps, top-down socio-economic development plans must coincide with bottom-up economic incentives and technology development.},
