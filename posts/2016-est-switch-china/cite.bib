	abstract = {We present an integrated model, {SWITCH}-China, of the Chinese power sector with which to analyze the economic and technological implications of a medium to long-term decarbonization scenario while accounting for very-short-term renewable variability. On the basis of the model and assumptions used, we find that the announced 2030 carbon peak can be achieved with a carbon price of ∼\$40/{tCO}2. Current trends in renewable energy price reductions alone are insufficient to replace coal; however, an 80\% carbon emission reduction by 2050 is achievable in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Target Scenario with an optimal electricity mix in 2050 including nuclear (14\%), wind (23\%), solar (27\%), hydro (6\%), gas (1\%), coal (3\%), and carbon capture and sequestration coal energy (26\%). The co-benefits of carbon-price strategy would offset 22\% to 42\% of the increased electricity costs if the true cost of coal and the social cost of carbon are incorporated. In such a scenario, aggressive attention to research and both technological and financial innovation mechanisms are crucial to enabling the transition at a reasonable cost, along with strong carbon policies.},
