Grateful to be included in the **[Stanford/Elsevier Top 2% Scientists List 2025](https://topscinet.com/scientist_profile/He,%20Gang/2004/?stype=single_year){.external target="_blank"}**:

- Enabling & Strategic Technologies
    - Environmental Sciences
    - Energy

This is the second time I've been included in this list. I want to take a moment to thank my family, current and former students, visiting scholars, mentors, collaborators, funders, editors, reviewers, and colleagues for their invaluable support.
