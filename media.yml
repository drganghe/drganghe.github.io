      author: Leonard Sparks
      description: "Driven by such factors as economies of scale, global supply chains and advances in technology, the average cost of solar power dropped by over 90 percent between 2010 and 2023, and for onshore and offshore wind by 73 percent and 65 percent, respectively, said Gang He, an energy policy expert from CUNY Baruch College."
