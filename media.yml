      description: "“Coal remains deeply embedded in the economic and social fabric of many Chinese communities,” said Gang He, associate professor at Baruch College, City University of New York, who specialises in energy and climate policies. “A transition away from coal is therefore not only an energy transformation, but also an economic and employment transition that must be managed with care.” “The ability of China to manage this transition in a rapid and just manner will have a significant impact on how it and, to a large extent, the world use energy and address climate change,” Gang said."
