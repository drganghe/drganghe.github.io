# Personal Github Page Powered by Quarto
 
This is the source file of my website using [Quarto](https//quarto.org). And by far, it is the easiest and most effective tool to build a site in my experience.

- Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

- Create a website: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>

- Copy the about.qmd from [blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) to your folder and rename it to index.qmd

- Update _quarto.yml and add content to your blog posts

- Publish it on Github Pages: <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/>

All very straightforward to set up. If you follow the steps, the website is running as expected.

You can check out the site at <https://drganghe.github.io>.

And you can follow my updates by adding <https://drganghe.github.io/posts.xml> to your RSS reader.

If youâ€™d like the layout and would like to use for your website, please avoid forking this repository directly, as you will receive notifications whenever I update it. 

If you choose to do so, please be sure to remove my personal Google Analytics ID and MS Clarity ID from your site. 

Instead, I recommend forking the [Quarto Academic website template](https://github.com/drganghe/quarto-academic-website-template) to build your own website.
