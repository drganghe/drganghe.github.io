Note: If youâ€™d like to use the template, please avoid forking my actual websites directly, as you will receive notifications whenever I update it. If you choose to do so, please be sure to remove my personal Google Analytics ID and MS Clarity ID from your site. Instead, I recommend forking the [Quarto Academic website template](https://github.com/drganghe/quarto-academic-website-template) to build your own website.


## Useful tips for building an academic Quarto site

### Using "Includes" for reusable content

To streamline updates across your site, use Quarto's [includes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) feature for reusable elements like syllabus statements, social sharing options, academic badges, and other reuseable materials. By doing this, you only need to update a single source file, and then rerender the site to reflect changes across all pages.

```markdown
"{{< include _statement.qmd >}}"
```

Prefixing include file names with an underscore ("_") ensures they won't be rendered directly by Quarto. 

Here is an example course [description](https://github.com/drganghe/energy-climate-policy/blob/main/files/includes/_coursedescription.qmd), and reuse it in [mainpage](https://github.com/drganghe/energy-climate-policy/blob/main/index.qmd) and [syllabus](https://github.com/drganghe/energy-climate-policy/blob/main/syllabus.qmd).


### Academic badges

Display academic badges like the [Dimension Citation badge](https://badges.dimensions.ai/) and [Altmetric badge](https://badge-docs.altmetric.com/getting-started.html). 

```{=html}
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'></script><script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js" charset="utf-8"></script><span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6" data-style="large_rectangle"></span><div data-badge-popover="right" data-badge-type="1" data-doi="10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6" data-hide-no-mentions="true" class="altmetric-embed"></div>
```

Here's an example for embedding them:

``` markdown{.code-overflow-wrap}
<span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6" data-style="large_rectangle"></span> <div data-badge-popover="right" data-badge-type="1" data-doi="10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6" data-hide-no-mentions="true" class="altmetric-embed"></div>
```
Replace the doi with your own.

Make sure to include below scripts in the same page to enable the badges:

```markdown
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'></script>

<script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

You can also showcase your highly cited and hot papers using custom badges.

![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/highly-cited-paper-badge.png "ESI Highly Cited Paper"){width=20 fig-alt="Highly cited paper"} ![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/hot-paper-badge.png "ESI Hot Paper"){width=20 fig-alt="Hot paper"}

```markdown
![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/highly-cited-paper-badge.png "ESI Highly Cited Paper"){width=20 fig-alt="Highly cited paper"} ![](https://drganghe.github.io/files/images/hot-paper-badge.png "ESI Hot Paper"){width=20 fig-alt="Hot paper"}
```

Here is an [example](https://drganghe.github.io/publications.html), and the [source code](https://github.com/drganghe/drganghe.github.io/blob/main/publications.qmd).


### Social sharing

For easy setup of social sharing buttons, [AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/buttons/for/website) is a simple solution. 

Using includes files here will make it easier to manage updates, as any changes to social buttons need only be made once.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/drganghe/drganghe.github.io/blob/main/files/includes/_socialshare.qmd).


### The art of listing

[Listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) are a powerful tool in Quarto, offering flexibility for creating visually appealing and organized pages. By adjusting listing options, you can control how content is presented.

Type: `default`, `grid`, `table`

Options: `grid-columns`, `image-height`, `grid-item-align`

Display: `fields` and `field-display-names`

By mastering these options, you can easily create pages that fit your content needs while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.

Here is an [example](https://deeppolicylab.github.io/research.html), and [source code](https://github.com/deeppolicylab/deeppolicylab.github.io/blob/main/research.qmd); another [example](https://deeppolicylab.github.io/events/2024-09-26-nyc-climate-week-clean-energy-global-supply-chains-panel/index.html), and [source code](https://github.com/deeppolicylab/deeppolicylab.github.io/blob/main/events/2024-09-26-nyc-climate-week-clean-energy-global-supply-chains-panel/index.qmd).

### Listing specific categories

To display a subset of items, use the `include` and `exclude` [options](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#including-or-excluding-items). Below is an example of listing publications by category:

```yaml
  content:
    - publications.yml
  include:
    categories: "supply-chain"
```
Here, `publications.yml` is a YAML file containing a list of publications with predfined `categories`, and `categories` is the key used for filtering. The result will display only publications that match the specified category.

Here is an [example](https://deeppolicylab.github.io/research/clean-energy-supply-chains/index.html), and [source code](https://github.com/deeppolicylab/deeppolicylab.github.io/blob/main/research/clean-energy-supply-chains/index.qmd).


### Listing external items

To list external resources with key metadata, you can use this format to create clear, linked listings.

```yaml
    - path: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6
      image: /files/images/journal/nature.avif
      title: "Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains"
      subtitle: "*Nature*"
      description: "Globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the U.S., Germany, and China $67B 2008-2020, and solar prices will be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically."
      date: "2022-10-26"
```

For efficiency, store multiple items in a YAML(.yml) file and reference it in Quarto.

Here is an [example](https://deeppolicylab.github.io/publications.html), and [source code](https://github.com/deeppolicylab/deeppolicylab.github.io/blob/main/publications.qmd).


### Exporting Quarto Revealjs slides to PDF

Revealjs's default [PDF Export](https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/) omits footnotes, which is not acceptable if citations and sources are used. A workaround is to use [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape): 

```bash
decktape automatic lecture1.html lecture1.pdf
```

If you encounter font error when opening the PDF:

>"Cannot extract the embedded font 'BAAAAA+SourceSansPro-Regular'. Some characters may not display or print correctly." 

Use Adobe Acrobat tools to fix it:

1. Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat. 
2. Go to `Use print production` > `Preflight` > `Analyze and fix it` (default options). 
3. Apply the necessary font correction.
