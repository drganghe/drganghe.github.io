  abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping the transportation energy landscape, providing a practical alternative to petroleum fuels for a growing number of applications. EV sales grew 55× in the past decade (2014–2024) and 6×~since 2020, driven by technological progress enabled by policies to reduce transportation emissions as well as industrial plans motivated by strategic value of EVs for global competitiveness, jobs and geopolitics. In 2024, 22\% of passenger cars sold globally were EVs and opportunities for EVs beyond on-road applications are growing, including solutions to electrify off-road vehicles, maritime and aviation. This Review updates and expands our 2020 assessment of the scientific literature and describes the current status and future projections of EV markets, charging infrastructures, vehicle–grid integration and supply chains in the USA. EV is the lowest-emission motorized on-road transportation option, with life-cycle emissions decreasing as electricity emissions continue to decrease. Charging infrastructure grew in line with EV adoption but providing ubiquitous reliable and convenient charging remains a challenge. EVs are reducing electricity costs in several US markets and coordinated EV charging can improve grid resilience and reduce electricity costs for all consumers. The current trajectory of technology improvement and industrial investments points to continued acceleration of EVs.},

Here, we use 39 years of hourly U.S. weather data, and a macro-scale energy model to evaluate capacities and dispatch in least cost, 100\% reliable electricity systems with wind and solar generation supported by long-duration storage (LDS; 10 h or greater) and battery storage. We find that the introduction of LDS lowers total system costs relative to wind-solar-battery systems, and that system costs are twice as sensitive to reductions in LDS costs as to reductions in battery costs. In least-cost systems, batteries are used primarily for intra-day storage and LDS is used primarily for inter-season and multi-year storage. Moreover, dependence on LDS increases when the system is optimized over more years. LDS technologies could improve the affordability of renewable electricity.},

  abstract = {This report presents a brief summary of the REPEAT Project’s analysis of the impacts of changes in federal policy proposed by the administration of President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress on the U.S. energy transition. President Trump and Congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace many of the legislative and regulatory policies created by the Biden Administration and 117th Congress to accelerate the transition to a cleaner U.S. energy system. In this report, we summarize the impacts of these repeals, including: An Executive Repeal scenario assesses the impact of executive actions the Trump administration has stated it will take to unwind Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. This includes repeal of all EPA greenhouse gas regulations, DOT vehicle fuel economy standards, and DOE efficiency rules. The scenario also assumes executive agencies freeze distribution of all unspent funding made available by the IRA and IIJA. We also analyze the impacts of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (OBBB)—Republicans' partisan budget ‘mega-bill,’ which substantially repeals nearly all of the tax credits enacted by the IRA to support clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing. The bill also rescinds unobligated funding for clean energy and climate programs enacted by the IRA and the IIJA. In this report, we model two versions of the bill: the version passed by the House of Representatives on May 22, 2025, and the final version passed by the Senate on July 1, 2025 and House on July 3, 2025. These scenarios all include the impacts of Executive Repeal as well. Additionally, we present Continued Biden-era Policies scenarios (in some cases spanning ‘Conservative’, ‘Mid-range’, and ‘Optimistic’ cases; the ‘Mid-range’ is most directly comparable to the OBBB and Executive Repeal cases), which assume the continuation of the full suite of policies enacted under the Biden Administration, including the combined impact the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA). This scenario also includes a set of regulatory policies enacted by the Biden Administration, including: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greenhouse gas emissions regulations on power plants, light and heavy vehicles, and oil and gas sector methane pollution; Department of Energy (DOE) efficiency standards; and Department of Transportation (DOT) vehicle fuel economy standards. The range of outcomes spanned by the three scenarios reflect uncertainty about the effectiveness of policy provisions and the potential impacts of constraints on siting, interconnection, supply chains and other rate-limiting factors. We also provide a Net-Zero Pathway benchmark scenario. This scenario reflects a transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2050. In summary, passage of the Republicans’ budget mega-bill*, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” of 2025 will: Raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by 28 billion dollars annually in 2030 and over 50 billion dollars in 2035. Increase average U.S. household energy costs by roughly 165 dollars per household per year in 2030 and over 280 dollars per household per year in 2035—an increase of about 7.5\% in 2030 and over 13\% in 2035. Reduce cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by \$0.5 trillion ~from 2025-2035. Reduce cumulative new solar capacity additions by \textasciitilde 29 gigawatts and wind capacity by \textasciitilde 43 gigawatts ~from 2025-2030, and by \textasciitilde 140 gigawatts (solar) and \textasciitilde 160 gigawatts (wind) through 2035. Decrease clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours—more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to our electricity supply today. Increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 190 million metric tons per year in 2030 and 470 million tons in 2035—or about 2 percent of 2005 emissions in 2030 and 7 percent in 2035. * - all relative to executive actions that President Trump plans to take without Congressional action. The combined effect of executive and legislative repeal of Biden-era policies is also presented in this report. Given the significant uncertainty about future outcomes, all results in this report should be considered approximate. REPEAT Project updates our analysis regularly as new data and inputs become available and new policies are proposed and enacted. Note that this work has not been subject to formal peer review.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the primary drivers of recent state-level trends in U.S. retail electricity prices. We summarize pricing trends, explore descriptive relationships, and employ regression models to quantify the influence of various factors. Although the recent national rise in retail prices has largely tracked inflation, state-level trends vary widely. We identify a number of factors that explain trends in subsets of states. States with the greatest price increases typically exhibited shrinking customer loads—partially linked to growth in net metered behind-the-meter solar—and had renewables portfolio standards (RPS) in concert with relatively costly incremental renewable energy supplies. By contrast, recent utility-scale wind and solar deployment that occurred outside RPS programs (but that benefited from tax incentives) had no discernible impact on increased retail prices. Hurricanes, storms and wildfires also contributed to sizable price increases in some states, most notably in California, where wildfire risk mitigation and liability insurance were major cost drivers. Fluctuations in natural gas prices—particularly following the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war—further contributed to sharp price increases through 2022–2023 in many states, with moderation in 2024. The relative influence of these factors varies across states and over time, and relationships may change in the future. Nonetheless, the findings underscore the diverse set of price determinants and highlight the need for continued research to inform effective policy and ensure customer affordability.},

Although growing literature has reported green job opportunities (e.g., solar technicians) as a potential solution to the displacement of coal sector workers, the extent to which green jobs are easily accessible, regarding co-location and skill requirements, remains unclear. Here, we explore this issue in the context of China’s coal phaseout toward the 2060 carbon neutrality target. Using a coal power plant retirement model of 3,765 coal power units, we find that coal power plant workers must travel long distances (178–242~km) to reach a green job site. When further considering job skill qualifications, in total, fewer than 15\% of these workers can easily access green jobs. Postponing the coal phaseout might further exacerbate the job transition challenge. Upstream industries of the renewable energy sector (e.g., electrical machinery), which can be located closer to coal power plants and have better job skill matching, can help alleviate the challenging prospect.},

Current trends in renewable energy price reductions alone are insufficient to replace coal; however, an 80\% carbon emission reduction by 2050 is achievable in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Target Scenario with an optimal electricity mix in 2050 including nuclear (14\%), wind (23\%), solar (27\%), hydro (6\%), gas (1\%), coal (3\%), and carbon capture and sequestration coal energy (26\%). The co-benefits of carbon-price strategy would offset 22\% to 42\% of the increased electricity costs if the true cost of coal and the social cost of carbon are incorporated. In such a scenario, aggressive attention to research and both technological and financial innovation mechanisms are crucial to enabling the transition at a reasonable cost, along with strong carbon policies.},

We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020–2050) of China's power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10–20\% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China's water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70\%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80\% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70\% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario.},

Here, we find that the heterogeneous strategy always provides the lowest system costs among all four strategies, where provinces with abundant renewable resources dominantly adopt Renewable-connected batteries while those with limited renewables dominantly adopt Demand-side batteries. However, which strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions depends on carbon prices. The Renewable-connected strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions when carbon prices are relatively low, and the heterogeneous strategy results in the lowest CO2 emissions only at extremely high carbon prices.},

	abstract = {China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter in 2022, aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The power sector will play a major role in this decarbonization process due to its current reliance on coal. Prior studies have quantified air quality co-benefits from decarbonization or investigated pathways to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. However, few have jointly assessed the potential impacts of accelerating decarbonization on electric power systems and public health. Additionally, most analyses have treated air quality improvements as co-benefits of decarbonization, rather than a target during decarbonization. Here, we explore future energy technology pathways in China under accelerated decarbonization scenarios with a power system planning model that integrates carbon, pollutant, and health impacts. We integrate the health effects of power plant emissions into the power system decision-making process, quantifying the public health impacts of decarbonization under each scenario. We find that compared with a reference decarbonization pathway, a stricter cap (20\% lower emissions than the reference pathway in each period) on carbon emissions would yield significant co-benefits to public health, leading to a 22\% reduction in power sector health impacts. Although extra capital investment is required to achieve this low emission target, the value of climate and health benefits would exceed the additional costs, leading to \$824 billion net benefits from 2021 to 2050. Another accelerated decarbonization pathway that achieves zero emissions five years earlier than the reference case would result in lower net benefits due to higher capital costs during earlier decarbonization periods. Treating air pollution impacts as a target in decarbonization can further mitigate both CO2 emissions and negative health effects. Alternative low-cost solutions also show that small variations in system costs can result in significantly different future energy portfolios, suggesting that diverse decarbonization pathways are viable.},

We find that even without specific CO2 constraints, declining renewable energy and storage costs enable a 26\% decline in CO2 emissions in 2040 compared to 2020 under the Reference scenario. Compared to the Reference scenario, pursuing 2 °C and 1.5 °C compatible carbon emission targets (85\% and 99\% decrease in 2040 CO2 emissions relative to 2020 levels, respectively) reduces air pollution-related premature deaths from electricity generation over 2020–2040 by 51\% and 63\%, but substantially increases annual average costs per unit of electricity demand in 2040 (21\% and 39\%, respectively). While the 2 °C pathway leads to a 3\% increase in electricity sector-related net labor compensation, the 1.5 °C pathway results in a 19\% increase in labor compensation driven by greater renewable energy deployment. Although disparities in health impacts across provinces narrow as fossil fuels phase out, disparities in labor compensation widen with wealthier East Coast provinces gaining the most in labor compensation because of materials and equipment manufacturing, and offshore wind deployment.},

	abstract = {The costs for solar photovoltaics, wind, and battery storage have dropped markedly since 2010, however, many recent studies and reports around the world have not adequately captured such dramatic decrease. Those costs are projected to decline further in the near future, bringing new prospects for the widespread penetration of renewables and extensive power-sector decarbonization that previous policy discussions did not fully consider. Here we show if cost trends for renewables continue, 62\% of China’s electricity could come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11\% lower than achieved through a business-as-usual approach. Further, China’s power sector could cut half of its 2015 carbon emissions at a cost about 6\% lower compared to business-as-usual conditions.},
