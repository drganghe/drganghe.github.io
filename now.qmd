A few things keep me busy these days:

## Kids

- Raising two young kids and spending 12 hours a day with them when school is closed

## Research 

::: {.callout-tip}

## Big picture question

How can we achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century to address climate change?   
How to make the clean energy transition more:

- Sustainable (energy and environment)
- Resilient (energy and climate) 
- Equitable (energy and justice) 

:::

- Working with Kaifang Luo, Michael Davidson, Ahmad Lashkaripour, Ilaria Mazzocco, Minghao Qiu and collaborators and partners on the project [Made in America: Drivers and Impacts of Domestic Clean Energy Manufacturing in the United States](https://madeinamerica.netlify.app/) supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
- Working with California China Climate Institute to study clean energy supply chains and power system resource adequacy   
- Working with Baruch colleagues on exploring energy burden among older adults and people with disabilities in New York City public housing communities  
- Working on the climate, air pollution, and human health effects of imported solar PV supported by the ClimateWorks Foundation  
- Collaborating with LBL on power system decarbonization  


### I welcome collaborations on

- Clean energy global supply chains
- Power system decarbonization modeling
- Climate impact on energy systems
- Just energy transition
- Energy-water-carbon nexus  
- Other interdisciplinary aspects of carbon neutrality
