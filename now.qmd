## Big picture question

How can we achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century to address climate change?   
How to make the clean energy transition more:

- Sustainable (energy and environment)
- Resilient (energy and climate) 
- Equitable (energy and justice) 

:::

- Working with California China Climate Institute to study clean energy supply chains and power system resources adequency   
- Working with Baruch colleagues on Exploring Energy Burden Among the Older Adults and People with Disabilities in New York City Public Housing Communities  
- Working on the climate, air pollution, and human health effect of imported solar PV supported by the ClimateWorks Foundation  
- Collaborating with LBL on power system decarbonization  


### Welcome collaborations on

- Clean energy global supply chain
- Power system decarbonization modeling
- Climate impact on energy systems
- Just energy transition
- Energy-water-carbon nexus  
- Other interdisciplinary aspects of carbon neutrality
